# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
A repository for "from scratch" machine learning algorithm implementation. From scratch simply means implementing these algorithms without use of additional packages such as scikit or tensorflow. Doing so requires the foundational understanding of the math going on behind the scenes with such algorithms. This being the case, these implementations generally use mathematical functions and randomly generated domains rather than utilizing real data, to allow us to focus on the math.
