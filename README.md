# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
A repository for "from scratch" machine learning algorithm implementation. From scratch simply means implementing these algorithms without use of additional packages such as scikit or tensorflow. Doing so requires the foundational understanding of the mathematical theory of the algorithms. This being the case, these implementations generally use mathematical functions and randomly generated domains rather than utilizing real data, to allow us to focus on the math. The overarching goal in this process is to develop an intuition for machine learning algorithms that serves as a basis for potential continuing research in the area.
